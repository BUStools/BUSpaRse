\title{Sort transcripts to the same order as in kallisto index}
\usage{
sort_tr2g(tr2g, file, kallisto_out_path, save = FALSE,
  file_save = "./tr2g_sorted.csv", verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{tr2g}{The data frame output from the \code{tr2g_*} family of functions.
Exactly one of \code{tr2g} and \code{file} should be missing.}

\item{file}{Character vector of length 1, path to a csv or tsv file with
transcript IDs and the corresponding gene IDs. Headers \code{transcript} and
\code{gene} must be present in the file.}

\item{kallisto_out_path}{Character vector of length 1, path to the directory
for the outputs of kallisto bus.}

\item{save}{Whether to save the output.}

\item{file_save}{File name of the file to be saved. If the directory in which
the file is to be saved does not exist, then the directory will be created.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to display progress.}

\item{\dots}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link[data.table]{fwrite}}, such
as \code{sep}, \code{quote}, and \code{col.names}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns \code{transcript} and \code{gene} and the
other columns present in \code{tr2g} or the data frame in \code{file}, with
the transcript IDs sorted to be in the same order as in the kallisto index.
When \code{save = TRUE}, the data frame is not only saved on disk but also
returned in the R session.
}
\description{
This function takes the data frame output from the \code{tr2g_*} family of
functions in this package as the input, and sorts it so the transcripts are
in the same order as in the kallisto index used to generate the \code{bus}
file. Sorting is vital to obtain the correct sparse matrix from the \code{bus}
file as equivalence class notations are based on the index of transcripts
in the kallisto index.
}
\details{
Since the attribute field of GTF and GFF3 files varies across sources, output
from \code{\link{tr2g_gtf}} and \code{\link{tr2g_gff3}} may need further
clean up. You may also supply gene and transcript IDs from other sources.
This function should be used after the clean up, when the transcript IDs in
the cleaned up data frame have the same format as those in \code{transcript}
